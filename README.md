This repository contains code examples for http://refactoring.guru/

You can help by submitting your own examples as pull requests to this repository.

Here's the list of priorities:

1. Simple examples in programming languages, which are not yet included. These require minimum labor, but produce a lot of value on the website. You can just copy the Java folder and translate all of them to your language of choice.

2. Interactive examples. These require more work. See README file in the "interactive" folder. The best way to start is to take java scenarios one by one and translate them to your language. You can debug your scenarios by importing them to this editor: http://refactoring.guru/editor/ (You will need to export scenarios from there and do a regular pull request though).
