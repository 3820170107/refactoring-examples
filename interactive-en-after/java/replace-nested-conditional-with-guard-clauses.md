Imagine a payroll system with special rules for employees who have passed away, live on their own, or have retired. These cases are unusual but do occur.

Continue performing replacements, one at a time.

And the last one.

After these changes, you can get rid of the <code>result</code> variable entirely.

Inline conditionals are often written by programmers taught that a method should contain only one exit point. But in reality, this rule is simplistic and obsolete.

If a method is no longer of interest at runtime, it is best to exit it as soon as possible. Forcing the reader to go over an empty <code>else</code> block only throws up roadblocks to understanding your intentions.

Let's run the final compile.

Now refactoring is complete. If you like, you can compare the old and new code.
